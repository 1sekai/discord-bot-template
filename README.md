# Discord bot template
## tl;dr
This is a code template that will help you build a Discord bot in a quick and elegant way. You just have to tweak a few settings to your liking, add your commands, and you'll be ready to go.

Adding new commands or temporal events is as simple as inheriting from an abstract class, which helps to keeping everything clean and simple.
## Pre-requisites
- Python >= 3.6 (though you can use 3.5 if you remove the [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498))
- You need to [register your bot and get a Discord API token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
- You should be at least familiar with Python 3 and with the basics of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) [(docs)](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
- You should also have some basic knowledge about what asynchronous programming is and [how it works in Python](https://snarky.ca/how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5/), but to be fairly honest you don't really have to in order to make this thing work. You can just throw in `async` or `await` whenever Python complains.
- You should know what a `virtualenv` is and how to set up one. Check [this](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv) out if the file name `requirements.txt` doesn't speak to you.


# Basic settings
You can edit the following parameters in the `settings.py` file:
- **COMMAND_PREFIX**: The prefix that will be used for all commands. It's a `!` by default, but you can change it to anything else. It doesn't have to be a single-character prefix.
- **BOT_TOKEN**: The private token for your bot. Make sure to keep it secret. I usually put it in an environment variable, but whatever works for you.
- **NOW_PLAYING**: The text that the bot will display as its now playing status. You can set it to anything *falsy* (`""`, `None`, `False`, ...) to disable it.
- **BASE_DIR**: This isn't really a setting, but you can use to build relative paths inside your code. It points to the directory where the settings file itself is stored.

# Running your bot
Just run `python your_bot.py` and everything should work just fine if all dependencies are met. Of course, you can rename `your_bot.py` to anything you want.

# Adding commands
Having all of your commands in a single file (or maybe even a single *switch*) gets ugly quickly as you start adding commands. We all know it makes for messy, often redundant code.

However, this template aims to simplify that process by letting you add new commands to your bot by just creating new files in the `commands` directory. It keeps everything simple and modularized, and allows you to focus in whatever you want your bot to do, without having to worry about the pre-processing steps needed to parse commands.
## How to add a new command
Let's say you want to create a `!random` command that allows your users to roll a random number between a lower and an upper bound. We'll see how:

### 1. Add a new file to the `commands` directory
You can name it any way you want, but you probably want to give it a meaningful name. So, we'll start by adding a `random_number.py` file.

### 2. Define a new command class in that file
Now that you've created a file for the new command, you have to create a new class **that inherits from BaseCommand**, just like this:
``` py
from commands.base_command import BaseCommand

class Random(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self):
        ...  # TO-DO

    async def handle(self, params, message, client):
        ...  # TO-DO
```
Please note that, unlike the name for the file itself, **THE CLASS NAME MATTERS**. Every class name will generate a command named after it, but in lowercase. So, our `Random` class will generate a `random` command.

### 3. Implement `__init__`
The BaseCommand class requires a description and a list of parameters that your command will accept as input. You can pass them just like this:
``` py
from commands.base_command import BaseCommand

class Random(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self):
        description = "Generates a random number between two given numbers"
        params = ["lower", "upper"]
        super().__init__(description, params)

    async def handle(self, params, message, client):
        ...  # TO-DO
```
In fact, you can use the exact same code for all your commands, just changing the value for `description` and `params`.

The command description will be displayed if someone uses `!commands`. The list of required parameters will be displayed too as well, but it also helps for ensuring that your command will always get at least as many parameters as it requires.

For instance, if you define `params` the same way we just did, your command will **never** run if someone calls `!random` with less than two parameters, and you don't even have to worry about that.

If your command doesn't require any parameters, you can set `params` to anything *falsy* (an empty list or `None` will do).

### 4. Implement `handle()`
The `handle` method will contain the actual logic for your command. It must accept the following parameters:
- **params**: A list containing the parameters provided by the user. For example, if someone sends `!random 1 10`, *params* will be `["1", "10"]`. This list is guaranteed to contain **at least** as many parameters as specified in `__init__`.
- **message**: The [discord.py Message object](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#message) for the message that caused the command to execute.
- **client**: The [discord.py Client object](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#client) for your bot, required to reply to a message, among other things.

Let's see a **very naÃ¯ve** implementation for the `!random` command, without performing any proper checks:
``` py
from commands.base_command import BaseCommand
from random import randint

class Random(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self):
        description = "Generates a random number between two given numbers"
        params = ["lower", "upper"]
        super().__init__(description, params)

    async def handle(self, params, message, client):
        lower_bound = int(params[0])
        upper_bound = int(params[1])
        rolled = randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)

        msg = f"{message.author.mention}, you rolled a {rolled}!"
        await client.send_message(message.channel, msg)
```

Of course, it might fail if the user provides something other than a number, or if lower_bound > upper_bound, but this is enough for the command to work.

That's it, you don't have to do anything else. Dropping a python file with that content in the `commands` folder will cause the new command to be recognized by the bot (a restart is needed, though).

Have a look at [commands/example_command.py](https://github.com/agubelu/discord-bot-template/blob/master/commands/example_command.py) for a more fool-proof implementation for `!random`.

### Isn't this a bit overkill?
Depends. If you have to implement a single, simple command, practicality beats purity. 

But if you want your bot to have many commands with minimal effort, keeping everything organized and tidy, plus a self-updating help command, it is definitely worth it. Don't do spaghetti code.
